FIRST STEP: (I did it remotely, parallized on Mac) estimate_SVI_coefficients_each_day.py is used to
get the SVI coefficients for each day

SECOND STEP: estimation_IV.py is used in second step and it uses the estimated parameters and estimates the IV for a given ttm
It has also some other code to estimate the average IV or some other special things that we did, using the clusters.
It might or might not be relevant, I don't remember.
